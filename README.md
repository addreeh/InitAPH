# InitAPH

InitAPH is an automated setup script for Windows that streamlines the installation of essential applications and custom configurations. It leverages Winget for app installations (e.g., PowerShell, Discord, Windows Terminal) and includes custom themes, cursor setups, and configuration files for apps like Vencord and Start11. The script checks for existing files, extracts ZIP archives without the root folder, and ensures PowerShell is updated to the latest version.
